## A Multi-Pathology Ballistocardiogram Dataset for Cardiac Function Monitoring and Arrhythmia Assessment

### ABSTRACT

Cardiac dysfunction is a significant factor in clinical diagnostics and treatment. Although traditional methods like echocardiogra- phy and blood biomarkers are effective, their limitations highlight the need for noninvasive, continuous monitoring solutions. Ballistocardiography (BCG), which detects subtle vibrations generated by the mechanical events of the heart, has emerged  as a promising tool for remote, noninvasive cardiovascular monitoring. This study presents a multi-pathology BCG dataset, including data from healthy participants, heart failure (HF) patients, and those with arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation (AF), premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), and premature atrial contractions (PACs). Synchronized electrocardiogram (ECG) and M-mode echocardiography data are also included, enabling a comprehensive view of cardiac function across various  conditions. This dataset is intended to support the development of advanced algorithms and facilitate clinical validation of BCG  for cardiovascular monitoring.
